<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>What is Apache Extras?</b>
  <br/><br/>
<a href="http://www.apache-extras.org/">Apache Extras</a> is a community of open source projects related to Apache Software Foundation projects or based on their technology. It provides the infrastructure services typically required by open source projects, such as code repositories, bug tracking, project web sites/wiki. Apache Extras is hosted by Google Code Project Hosting, so it will be very familiar to developers already using Google Code Project Hosting.
   <br/><br/> 
  </li>
  <li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>I have a technical questions about Apache Extras. How do I get support?</b>
  <br/><br/> 
Please contact the normal Google Code Project Hosting support channels. Help is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/">code.google.com/p/support/</a>
<br/><br/> 
   </li>
   <li style="list-style-type: decimal">
   <b>What are the rules of hosting a project on Apache Extras?</b>
   <br/><br/>
All projects hosted on Apache Extras agreed to the standard Google Code Project Hosting terms of use <a href="http://code.google.com/projecthosting/terms.html">code.google.com/projecthosting/terms.html</a> and the <a href="guidelines.html">Apache Extras User Guidelines</a>.
   <br/><br/>
   </li>
   <li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>Are projects on Apache Extras official Apache Software Foundation projects?</b>
  <br/><br/>

No, Apache Extras projects are not official Apache Software Foundation projects. Apache Extras projects are not hosted by the Apache Software Foundation and do not have to follow the Apache Software Foundation development and intellectual property policies.
<br/><br/>
There are a number of things Apache Extras projects should not do since they are not official Apache Software Foundation projects, including 1) include the word Apache in their name, 2) use the org.apache namespace for their bundles or package names. Exceptions to these guidelines must be documented through official discussion by the responsible Apache project committee on its public mailing lists and will be dealt with on a case by case basis.
<br/><br/>
   </li>
   <li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>When should I consider using Apache Extras vs starting a project in the Apache Incubator?</b>
   <br/><br/>   
Apache Extras projects are not official Apache Software Foundation projects. Apache Extras is not a replacement for the Apache Incubator, which is the official way for a project to join the Apache Software Foundation. 
<br/><br/>
Apache Extras has been established for projects that don't want to, or are unable to be a formal part of the Apache Software Foundation but still wish to demonstrate their affinity to one ore more official Apache project.
<br/><br/>
We recommend starting a project here if one or more of the following is true:
<br/><br/>
      <ul>
      <li>the project is experimental and the committers are not sure of the future direction.</li>
      <li>the project has a license or depends on a license that is not compatible with the Apache License 2.0</li>
      <li>the project is targeted at a small niche and might not benefit from the wider exposure of being an Apache Software project.</li>
      </ul>
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>Is it possible for an Apache Extras project to become an official Apache Software Foundation project?</b>
<br/><br/>
Yes, but if you expect your project to eventually become an Apache project, please evaluate the option to propose it as a new Apache Incubator project. In any case, the following suggestions will facilitate a future migration to Apache Incubator : a) choose the Apache License 2.0 as your initial license. b) do not include or link to any code that is not compatible with Apache License 2.0, see <a href="http://www.apache.org/legal/resolved.html">ASF Legal Previously Asked Questions</a> for more details on Apache License 2.0 compatibility. c) keep track of all contributions and ensure they are contributed under an Apache License 2.0 compatible license.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>I have an existing project on Google Code, can I migrate it to Apache Extras?</b>
<br/><br/>
If you have an existing project on Google Code that you would like to migrate to Apache Extras, file an issue <a href="http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/entry?template=ASF%20migration%20request">here</a>. Once an issue is filed, you will be contacted within the next 48 hours with instructions for how to migrate your project.
<br/><br/>
</li>
<li style="list-style-type: decimal">
  <b>Why can't I use Git?</b>
<br/><br/>
Google Code Project Hosting only provide support for Subversion and Mercurial. Apache Extras is hosted at Google Code Project Hosting so we use their code managements systems.

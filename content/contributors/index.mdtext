This page is intended for those people who are reasonably 
comfortable with open source development models but need a helping hand finding 
their way around The Apache Software Foundation.

At the time of writing we don't have much here, so we suggest you mail us

## Project Independence

While not all aspects of the Apache Way are practiced the same way by 
all projects at the ASF, there are a number of rules that Apache 
projects are required to follow â€“ things like complying with PMC 
[release voting][1], [legal policy][2], [brand policy][3], 
using [mailing lists][4], etc., which are [documented in various places][5]. 

One of these invariant rules is that projects are managed and used
independently of any commercial interests. The goal is to createan 
environemnt in which all participants are equal and thus have an equal
opportunity to contribute to and benefit from our software, regardless
of motivation or financial objectives. This is discussed in more detail
in our document [Project Independence][6].

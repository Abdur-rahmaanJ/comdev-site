Title: Pilot Mentoring Programme with India ICFOSS

The ASF has been participating in many mentoring initiatives, and it's now
partening in a pilot project with India ICFOSS to provide mentoring for 
undergraduated and graduated students that have interest in learning how
to participate in open source communitites at ASF.

The mentoring programme is not here to teach you to write documentation or
code. It is here to help you understand how to make a valuable contribution
to an Apache project. You can expect to be guided through our contribution
processes. You can also expect to get technical support with respect to
your chosen project. You cannot expect your mentor to be a "teacher", they
will provide enough information for you to progress within the project. You
need to bring the confidence to take their guidance and discover the detail
for yourself.

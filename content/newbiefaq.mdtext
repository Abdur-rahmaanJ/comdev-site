## What projects can I find in The Apache Software Foundation?

There are a great many projects in The Apache Software Foundation. We have
four classes of project:

 * [Top Level Projects](http://www.apache.org)
 - these are projects with healthy communities and active development
 * [Incubating Projects](http://incubator.apache.org)
 - these are projects that have still to build a sustianble community, but
have active development
 * [Labs](http://labs.apache.org)
 - these are experiments being carried out by existing committers
 * [Attic](http://attic.apache.org)
 - these are end-of-life projects that are no longer receiving active
development, but may still be useful

## How are projects managed in The Apache Software Foundation

Apache projects all believe that if we look after the community then good
code will emerge from that community. That is, when people with similar
needs come together they will work out a way of solving their common
problems. It is for this very reason that we created the Community
Development project (where you are right now), the ASF has grown to be very
large and, from the outside, can look too mature for newcomers and novices.
However, these communities seek to be flat in structure. No single person
in that community has more influence than the next, a newcomer with a good
idea has just as much input and influence as the original creator of the
project.

We do have a system that we call meritocracy that allows those who have
demonstrated commitment and understanding to the community to earn certain
privileges, such as being able to make changes directly to documentation
and programme code. However, these privileges simply streamline the
process, they do not (in most cases) give additional powers over the
project.

In summary, Apache Projects work because people like you participate
constructively within them. 

To learn more about "The Apache Way" see the foundations [How It Works](http://apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html)
 pages.

## How do I learn about the way Apache Projects Work?

You should consider applying to the [Apache Mentor Programme](mentoringprogramme.html)
. We will help you find a mentor within the project of your choice. They
will take you through a semi-formal mentoring programme] that will ensure
you quickly find your feet. There is no cost other than a promise to commit
some of your time to the goals you agree with your mentor.

<a name="NewbieFAQ-HowdoIaskaquestionabouttheASFingeneral?"></a>
## How do I ask a question about the ASF in general?

The Community Development Project is here for this very purpose. Check out
the resources on this site first, if you don't find the answer send a mail
to mailto:dev@community.apache.org (subscribe first by sending a mail to
mailto:dev-subscribe@community.apache.org)

<a name="NewbieFAQ-HowdoIgetusersupportforanASFproject?"></a>
## How do I get user support for an ASF project?

Everyone active in ASF projects is here as a volunteer, nobody is paid to
provide support here. So the first thing to realise is that you need to be
careful not to waste peoples time, so do your homework. Generally, if
people can see that you have tried to solve your problem they are more
likely to help. So, before asking a question do the following:

* search the project documentation
* search the project user lists
* search the issue tracker for any related known issues
* search the web in general

If you don't find a solution send a concise, but detailed, request for
support to the appropriate user mailing list (you will usually need to
subscribe first). Indicate that you have read the appropriate documentation
and explain what you have tried, what you expect to happen and what
actually happens.

Be patient waiting for a response, give it at least three working days
before you send a second message. People are busy, they will deal with your
request when they can. If you need urgent help it is best not to rely on
the community support channels and find someone willing to support you for
a fee.

It is worth noting that people are more willing to help those who
contribute back to the project in some way. If you hit a problem that was
not documented then it is likely others will too. A good idea is to send a
patch to the project to improve its documentation. This means that those
who follow in your footsteps get an answer in the first step above and you
start to build merit in the community that will result in further help in
the future.

A second way of contributing is to provide user support to others as your
expertise grows. Again, earning merit in this way will help ensure you get
the support you need in the future.

# Getting Involved with Apache projects

<a name="NewbieFAQ-HowdoIchooseanApacheprojecttoworkon?"></a>
## How do I choose an Apache project to work on?

The key to working on projects at Apache (and any open source for that
matter) is to have a personal reason for being involved. You might be
trying to solve a day job issue, you might be looking to learn a new
technology or you might simply want to do somethiung fun in your free time.
The key is that you must *want* to get involved. It is also important that
you have appropriate skills to be able to help the project.

Our [projects](http://projects.apache.org/)
 provides a useful index of projects which allows you to view projects
alphabetically, by category or by language. When you view a projects detail
page in this list you will find details of their mailing lists, issue
tracker and other resoutrces.

In the projects issue tracker you will find details of bugs and feature
requests the project would like to work with, this should give you some
inspiration about how you might be able to help the project community. If
you see an issue you would like to tackle its time to join the projects
mailing list and get started.

<a name="NewbieFAQ-HowdoIgetinvolvedwithanApacheproject?"></a>
## How do I get involved with an Apache project?

You can certainly improve your programming skills by watching the commit
lists, receiving code reviews and participating in discussion. Howeverm
this learning opportunity is a healthy side effect of open source
activities rather than a goal in itself. Nobody in an Apache project is
going to spend time teaching you programming 101, technical writing or
testing (to pick just a few skills we need). You need to know the basics
and be willing to research the rest.

Our mentoring programme, see below, is designed to help you understand how
to get guidance with respect to how to take your first steps in an open
source project. You will also find our [get involved](http://apache.org/foundation/getinvolved.html)
 page a uaseful starting point.

<a name="NewbieFAQ-IsthereaCodeofConductforApacheprojects?"></a>
## Is there a Code of Conduct for Apache projects?

Here at Apache projects are free to define their own code of conduct.
However, it is common for new projects to learn from the lessons of the
older projects. The Apache Incubator project has a wiki page for collecting [common elements of Apache project Codes of Conduct](http://incubator.apache.org/guides/community.html)
.

The Incubator document has some really useful for both the newbie and the
old hands (we all fall into bad habits occasionally). The section on ASF
Mottos is especially useful as a reminder of the way things are in most ASF
projects. This section includes such gems as:

* Put community before code. 
* Let they that do the work make the decisions. 
* If it didn't happen on a mailing list, it didn't happen. 
* Don't feed the trolls.

### What is the Apache Mentoring Programme

Many projects in the ASF are able to provide mentors for newcomers. In
fact, most projects are happy to assist newcomers to their projects as part
of their normal operations. However, some people are looking for more
structure. The Mentor Programme of the The Apache Software Foundation
provides additional support and structure for people looking to make an
initial contribution to an ASF project.

For more information see our [mentoring page](mentoringprogramme.html)
.

<a name="NewbieFAQ-HowdoIApplytotheMentorProgramme?"></a>
### How do I Apply to the Mentor Programme?

Take a look at our [mentoring page](mentoringprogramme.html). If you are 
planning on working on an Apache project as part of your formal education you 
should also read [mentoring in formal education|mentorProgrammeFormalEducation]
.

From the [mentoring page](mentoringprogramme.html) you will see that you 
need to complete an [application](mentorprogrammeapplication.html). This 
gives us enough background information to enable us to approach your
chosen project community and for you to work with prospective mentors in
defining your mentored activity.

	<p>Identifying potential new committers, calling a vote for their recognition
as a committer and processing the relevant documents is something to which
the whole community can contribute.</p>
<p>Each project has a different approach to managing new committers. This page
describes a common process found in many Apache projects. It also provides
drafts for the various communications that are necessary.</p>

<h2 id="guidelines-for-assessing-new-candidates-for-committership">Guidelines for assessing new candidates for committership</h2>
<p>When voting, all PMC members need to make up their own minds as to whether a candidate
should be approved to become a committer. They might search mailing lists and JIRA to see
how the candidate interacts.</p>
<p>All new committers <strong>must</strong> adhere to the <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html">Apache Code of Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>Each PMC may want to create their own supplemental committer guidelines; here are the <a href="http://forrest.apache.org/committed.html">Apache Forrest committer guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>The following are some points to consider when assessing a candidate&rsquo;s qualifications for committership.</p>

later in this document.</p>
<p><a name="NewCommitter-Summary"></a></p>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ol>
<li>Call a vote (templates/committerVote.txt)</li>
<li>Close the vote</li>
<li>Invite the new committer (templates/committerInvite.txt)</li>
</ol>
<p>If they accept, then do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Accept the committer (templates/committerAccept.txt)</li>
<li>Wait until we see that receipt of CLA is recorded</li>
<li>Request creation of the committer account (template/committerCreate.txt)
<ol>
<li>now wait until root says it is done</li>
<li>PMC Chair to enable svn and other access</li>
<li>Add committer to the appropriate groups in JIRA and CWiki</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Notify the committer of completion (template/committerDone.txt)</li>
<li>If committer is also to be a PMC member, PMC Chair sends email to board@ asking for acknowledgement of new PMC member
(templates/email-member-ack.txt)</li>
<li>Announce the new committer (template/committerAnnounce.txt)</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="NewCommitter-Discussion"></a></p>
<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>We do the vote on the private mailing list to enable a frank discussion.</p>
<p>Start a separate [VOTE] thread for each new person. This makes it much easier
to review the mail archives.</p>
<p>We need to be sure that they are committed people that we can work with.
They will be our peers. We will have already observed that they are
committed to the project and graceful toward users and other developers.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t wait too long before proposing and don&rsquo;t be too hasty. There is a
trade-off and something about timeliness. A point is reached where it
becomes obvious that we should invite them. This encourages them and keeps
them enthusiastic. If we leave it too long, then we risk them becoming
disillusioned.</p>
<p>On the PMC list we can each say exactly what we feel about each person,
with no holds barred. Keep the discussion concise. The praise part can
be done later in public. Keep in mind, however, that if the member becomes
a PMC member later, they will have access to this discussion.</p>
<p>Let the Vote thread run for one week.</p>
<p>A positive result is achieved by <strong>Consensus Approval</strong>: i.e. at least 3 +1
votes and no vetoes.</p>
<p>Any veto must be accompanied by reasoning and the vetoer must be prepared to defend it.
Other members can attempt to encourage them to change their minds.</p>
<p>New committers can be either quiet or active as they choose. If we find
that certain people lapse and don&rsquo;t ever contribute, then each project can take steps
to retire them.</p>
<p>After a positive result, record the result on the PMC list with a [RESULT][VOTE] subject
and then invite the candidate. We give candidates a chance to decline committership in private. They
can post a reply to the PMC mailing list.</p>
<p>After we reach a decision on the PMC list, and after the steps above, we
will announce it on the dev list. We can then each follow up with
our praise in public.</p>

Subject: Invitation to become [PROJECT] committer: Joe Bloggs
    
Hello [invitee name],

The [Project] Project Management Committee] (PMC) 
hereby offers you committer privileges to the project 
[as well as membership in the PMC]. These privileges are
offered on the understanding that you'll use them
reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust
rather than unnecessary constraints. 

Being a committer enables you to more easily make 
changes without needing to go through the patch 
submission process. [Being a PMC member enables you 
to guide the direction of the project.]

Being a committer does not require you to 
participate any more than you already do. It does 
tend to make one even more committed.  You will 
probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a 
contributor, participating as you do now.

A. This personal invitation is a chance for you to 
accept or decline in private.  Either way, please 
let us know in reply to the [private@project.apache.org] 
address only.

B. If you accept, the next step is to register an iCLA:
    1. Details of the iCLA and the forms are found 
    through this link: http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

    2. Instructions for its completion and return to 
    the Secretary of the ASF are found at
    http://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting

    3. When you transmit the completed iCLA, request 
    to notify the Apache [Project] and choose a 
    unique Apache id. Look to see if your preferred 
    id is already taken at 
    http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html     
    This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC 
    when your iCLA has been recorded.

When recording of your iCLA is noticed, you will 
receive a follow-up message with the next steps for 
establishing you as a committer.
</code></pre>
<h3 id="committer-accept-template">Committer Accept Template</h3>
<p>This is the followup email after the new committer has accepted the invitation</p>
<pre><code>------------------------------------------------------------------------
To: JoeBloggs@foo.net
Cc: private@[PROJECT].apache.org
Subject: Re: invitation to become [PROJECT] committer

Welcome. Here are the next steps. After that we will make
an announcement to the [PROJECT]-dev list.

You need to send a Contributor License Agreement to the ASF.
Normally you would send an Individual CLA. If you also make
contributions done in work time or using work resources then
see the Corporate CLA. Ask us if you have any issues.
http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

You need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives.
In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at
http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

Please notify us when you have submitted the CLA and by what means 
you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the CLA has 
been recorded.

After that is done, please make followup replies to the [PROJECT]-dev list.
We generally discuss everything there and keep the
private@[PROJECT].apache.org list for occasional matters which must be private.

The developer section of the website describes the roles and provides other
resources:
  http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
  http://www.apache.org/dev/

The incubator also has some useful information for new committers
in incubating projects:
  http://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html
  http://incubator.apache.org/guides/ppmc.html

Just as before you became a committer, participation in any ASF community
requires adherence to the ASF Code of Conduct:
  https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

[PROJECT should insert its own guidelines here; if none are available,
 the Apache Forrest guidelines are available as a template.]
  http://forrest.apache.org/guidelines.html

Yours,
The Apache [PROJECT] PMC

<p>If the ICLA identifies the project and a valid Apache id, and the
[RESULT][VOTE] message has been posted to the PMC private list, then
the account creation request is made by the
secretary or assistant who files the ICLA.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the new account request should be made by the
PMC Chair (or any <a href="https://www.apache.org/foundation/glossary.html#Member">ASF Member</a> if the chair is unavailable).</p>
<p>The PMC chair needs to use the <a href="https://id.apache.org/acreq/pmc-chairs/">ASF New Account Request</a> form to
send a new account request. Members may use <a href="https://id.apache.org/acreq/members/">ASF New Account
Request</a> page for ASF members to use.</p>
<p>For elections held on public lists, please supply the
<a href="http://mail-archives.apache.org/">mail-archives.apache.org</a> url. For private lists, you can
use the <a href="https://mail-search.apache.org/">Mail Search tool</a> to locate the apprpropriate url.</p>

Subject: new committer: ###Joe Bloggs

The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache [PROJECT]
has invited Joe Bloggs to become a committer and we are pleased 
to announce that he has accepted.

### add specific details here ###

Being a committer enables easier contribution to the
project since there is no need to go via the patch
submission process. This should enable better productivity.
Being a PMC member enables assistance with the management
and to guide the direction of the project.

Subject: account request: ###Joe Bloggs

####, as you know, the ASF Infrastructure has set up your
committer account as the username '####'.

Please follow the instructions to set up your SSH,
svn password, svn configuration, mail forwarding, etc.
http://www.apache.org/dev/#committers

[If your project automatically adds committers to the PMC]
Please subscribe to the [PROJECT] Project Management 
Committee mailing list private@[PROJECT].apache.org.
[/If]

You have commit access to specific sections of the
ASF repository, as follows:

[PROJECT] has various resources at:
  https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]

The general &quot;committers&quot; at:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/private/committers

You will probably need to 'svn switch&quot; previous checkouts to now use https, 
for example:

svn switch --relocate http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT] https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/[PROJECT]
    
If you have any questions during this phase, then please
see the following resources:

Apache developer's pages: http://www.apache.org/dev/
Incubator committer guide: http://incubator.apache.org/guides/committer.html

Naturally, if you don't understand anything be sure to ask us on the [PROJECT] dev mailing list. 
Documentation is maintained by volunteers and hence can be out-of-date and incomplete - of course
you can now help fix that.

A PMC member will announce your election to the dev list soon.

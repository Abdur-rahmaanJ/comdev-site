*The more you give the more you get out*. 

It's natural to assume that, as a newcomer, 
you have little to offer the ASF. However, you will be surprised at
how much you can help, even now. 

Since we aim to be a place for newcomers to learn
about the ASF as a whole and you are (probably) a newcomer *any feedback
you can give or unanswered questions you can ask us here* will help us improve what
we offer to those who come afterwards. Our [etiquette tips](/contributors/etiquette) can help you 
write emails that will get some answers.

Feedback can be provided on this website and questions asked about anything Apache by subscribing to our mailing
list by sending a mail to 
[dev-subscribe@community.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@community.apache.org). Once subscribed you can send your mail to
[dev@community.apache.org](mailto:dev@community.apache.org).

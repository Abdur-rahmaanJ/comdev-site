title: use the Comdev Issue Tracker For GSoC Tasks
---

If your project does not use the ASF's JIRA for issue tracking, you can use
the Community Development project to record your GSoC tasks. 

* Add tasks to the [Comdev project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMDEV)
* Ensure you add the labels `gsoc2021`, `mentor` and `_YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_`
* Your issues will then appear in the [list of projects](https://s.apache.org/gsoc2021ideas)
* We use the label `_YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_` to map COMDEV issues to the real project when we create the ideas list

Please contact dev@community.apache.org if you have questions/difficulties.

You can then link to this from your own site and access XML, RSS feeds.

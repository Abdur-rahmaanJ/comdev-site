title: use the Comdev Issue Tracker For GSoC Tasks
---

If your project does not use the ASFs JIRA for issue tracking you can use
the Community Development project to record your GSoC tasks. 

* Add tasks to the [Comdev project](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/COMDEV)
* Ensure you add the labels "*gsoc2021*", "*mentor*" and "*_YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_*"
* Your issues will then appear in the [list of projects](https://s.apache.org/gsoc2021ideas)
* Label "*_YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_*" will be used to map COMDEV issues to the real project while creating ideas list

Please contact dev@community.apache.org if you have questions/difficulties

You can then link to this from your own site and access XML, RSS feeds.
